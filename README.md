# Nagarro-summer-internship

Assignments and projects at my 2-month internship at Nagarro. I went above and beyond my assigned work and implemented new features and nice-to-have to the apps. Some of the projects:

### [Modern to-do list](https://corbe30.github.io/Nagarro-summer-internship/Assignment-4_Nagarro-todo-jQuery/)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Corbe30/Nagarro-summer-internship/main/images/to-do.png)
A responsive modern to-do list web app that supports speech-to-text, reorder tasks, edit & mark-as-done support and local storage on the fly. Inspired by minimalism. 
Reordering is supported by SortableJS. Web Speech API is used to implement speech-to-text feature. jQuery was used to build the rest.

### [Neumorphic Calculator](https://corbe30.github.io/Nagarro-summer-internship/Project-2_calculator/)
